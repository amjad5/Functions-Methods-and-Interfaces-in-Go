# Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go

## Overview

This repository documents my learning journey through the "Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go" course by the University of California, Irvine, offered on Coursera. The course covers fundamental concepts, focusing on functions, methods, and interfaces in the Go programming language. The repository includes code assessments to reinforce the understanding of each module.

## Week 1: Functions and Organisation

The first module introduces the concept of functions and demonstrates their use in manipulating data programmatically. The topics covered include basic features and purposes of functions, benefits of using pointers, and differences between passing slices and arrays as function arguments.

### Learning Objectives

- Identify the basic features and purposes of functions.
- Understand the benefits of using pointers in function manipulation.
- Differentiate between passing a slice and an array as function arguments.
- Utilize functions and slices to implement a sorting routine for integers.

### Assessment

- [bubblesort.go](Week%201/bubblesort.go)

## Week 2: Function Types

The second module continues exploring the use of functions in Go, delving into advanced types, properties, and practical applications. The week includes developing a routine that solves a physics problem using Go functions.

### Learning Objectives

- Identify advanced types, properties, and uses of functions.
- Understand the output resulting from running a given code block containing functions.
- Develop a routine containing functions in Go to solve a practical physics problem.

### Assessment

- [displacement.go](Week%202/displacement.go)

## Week 3: Object Orientation in Go

Functions in Go offer powerful capabilities, and this module explores their usage in an object-oriented manner. Topics covered include the basic properties and uses of objects and classes, differences between structs (in Go) and classes (in object-oriented languages), and the usage of methods and different data types.

### Learning Objectives

- Identify the basic properties and uses of objects and classes.
- Differentiate between structs (in Go) and classes (in an object-oriented language).
- Understand the uses of methods and different data types.
- Develop an interactive Go routine that utilizes classes, objects, instances, structs, and methods to query the properties of existing instances.

### Assessment

- [animal.go](Week%203/animal.go)
